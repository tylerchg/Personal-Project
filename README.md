# Why the Federal Reserve May Continue to Raise Interest Rates in 2023

**"Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates again this year?"** is the question I have been asked more than I can remember from both friends and clients year-round. 2022-2023 has been an absurd period in the world of finance as the Fed went from holding the federal funds rate at around zero as recently as the first quarter of 2022 to increasing the federal fund rate a total of 11 times; making it the highest level in over 22 years. Federal Reserve officials have in recent months emphasized the importance of how their decisions will be increasingly data-dependent and noted the significance of analyzing incoming data to determine monetary policy changes moving forward. So I wanted to explore deeper into the past U.S. macroeconomic data to help better understand the present and prepare for the future for an uncertain economy. 

Questions I wanted to answer:
- What kind of consequences would higher interest rates have on the U.S. economy and what would that mean for investors?
- Is the U.S. economy heading into a recession or will there be a "soft landing"?
- Why is the Federal Reserve targeting an inflation rate of 2%?
- Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates of another 25 basis points?
- What are the leading economic indicators to analyze the overall strength of the U.S. economy? What were they like during the past recessions?
