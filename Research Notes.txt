Question to ask myself: If inflation remains high does that mean interest rates will have to continue to rise? Let’s say 7% inflation becomes the norm for the next few years. Would banks continue to lend money for less than inflation? So doesn’t that mean interest rates would have to rise? Ultimately, who would be lending money at less than the inflation rate?
(Well people will continue to lend, but at a much lower pace.. Let’s say I have a dollar. That dollar will always have a nominal interest rate of 0%. With inflation being 7%, it will have a real interest rate of -7%. If I loan out that dollar, even if it’s for 0.5%, I would be better off, because then my real return will be -6.5% instead of -7%. It’s not great, but it’s still better than the inflation rate. Plenty of yields are less than the inflation rate. If inflation is persistently above 2% the central bank will eventually raise rates to push it down. If we see rising interest rates that will most likely be why.)

Question to ask myself: Why is the federal reserve target 2% inflation and not anything lower or higher? 
(During a recession, output falls and unemployment rises. In response, the central bank usually cuts the nominal interest rate in an attempt to return output and employment to normal levels. However, the nominal interest rate cannot go below zero. So higher inflation target gives the central bank more room to maneuver during recessions. Most economists agree that a little bit of deflation is worse than a medium amount of inflation. That’s because deflation can discourage consumption and investment. So having 2% base rate can help the economy avoid falling into deflationary trap. Also 2% inflation rate makes it possible to keep wages stable or even rising in nominal terms while making workers and employment more affordable overall. 2% inflation rate implies that more money its being created and introduced into the economy than a 0% inflation rate. This provides a slight economic boost without major costs to the economy. A 2% inflation rate per year usually isn’t very noticeable to the average person and doesn’t negatively impact their lives. Also, 2% inflation rate gives the central bank more room to lower the real interest rate to stimulate the economy.)

Question to ask myself: Why is it important to look into GDP and investments?
(One side is that level of spending today determines the level of consumption today - GDP & Investing provide higher output in the future, since people are buying are machines, develop new technologies, etc. and the more they invest, the higher the growth rate is. In short, spending determines the level of consumption today, investment determines the growth rate of consumption for the future. And obviously with 100% spending you get no growth and with 100% investing nobody consumes anything which is also pretty bad so you need the box of both.)
 

Problem Statement:
- There’s been a lot of uncertainty determining where the U.S. economy is heading towards. Will the federal reserve raise another 25 basis points (interest rates) to handle high inflation? What kind of consequences would that have towards the economy if at all? Will there be a “soft landing” in the U.S. Economy? Is the U.S. economy heading towards a recession or stagflation? Will these outcomes affect the unemployment? Is 2% inflation target a good thing? How does monetary policy affect real interest rates? 

- History: Usually when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, unemployment numbers goes up and it could lead to a potential decline in equities. Higher rates make borrowing costs to go up for companies (impacting their profitability), while rising unemployment suggests a slowdown in economic growth. However, 2023 seems to be the inconsistent (how so?) - so what metrics should people be looking at to help determine the direction market is going in? What has caused this? I believe looking into the data of where real interest rates are becoming more important. 

- Question: To understand the effect on the U.S economy in different parts of history where inflation was less than or equal to 2% (Looking at different times and events) since that is the current target for the federal reserves. So looking into the past data help us look at the overall future health/strength of the U.S. economy and where it is heading towards? What economic indicators are we looking for to help predict market trends? GDP, unemployment, inflation, real interest, and consumption. (Maybe private investment?) This analysis will help other investors have a better idea/understanding of where the economy is heading, and we need to know something about the government’s role in influencing its directions by looking into the real interest rate.

- Explanation to why picking each data: GDP is used to measure the size of the economy. When GDP is growing rapidly, then that usually means that more jobs are being created, etc. When GDP is shrinking, or growing slowly, then that’s a leading indicator that parts of the economy are in trouble. Unemployment rate is a measure of workplace participation “how many people are looking for work”. 

Understanding the Dataset (Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Rate):
- Real Interest Rate vs. Nominal Interest Rate and effect on inflation: An increase in nominal interest rates only decrease inflation if the increase in nominal interest rates was caused by contraction in the money supply (this is the liquidity effect).
- Why are some times in history where nominal interest rates in the U.S. is much lower than the actual interest rate? Doesn’t that invalidate Fisher’s theory of how they should move in tandem? (Many economists believe in a long-run Fisher effect and this property occurs in many modern economic models. In Fisher’s hypothesis, increase in inflation should reduce real interest rates, unless nominal interest rate is increased)
- Negative real interest rate environment means that inflation is greater than the nominal interest rate. This means that the purchasing power of the money being saved is decreasing, as the cost of goods and services is increasing at a faster rate than the interest earned on the savings. In other words, the saver is actually losing money in real terms, even though they may be earning interest on their savings account. This can happen when the central bank sets a ver low nominal interest rate in order to stimulate economic growth. Does this mean banks are not lending (blaming quantitative tightening) since they don’t want to lose money when lending to borrowers? 
- Going back to the previous question: Why are markets more focused on real rates now? It’s no secret that nominal rates have been declining for a long time. COVID accelerated that trends as investors flocked to safe haven assets like Treasuries during the crisis, but why are investors still investing when real yields have been pushing more and more negative? It could be upside surprises in job growth, even more profound moves in fiscal spending, sooner-than-expected rate hikes by the Fed, or the realization that “transitory” inflation might be much longer than expected. In BlackRock’s view, the most powerful catalyst may be a starkly positive real growth surprise that will finally move the non-economic-players resulting in the real rate economics to matter once again and significantly elevating nominal rates.
- Real interest rates are dictated by the rate of inflation. Higher inflation rates erode consumers’ purchasing power and the amount of interest earned from investments such as deposits.
- Nominal interest rates are the rates set by financial institutions, such as banks and credit card companies, to be paid as interest on borrowed money. These are also the rates at which money can be earned from a savings account, bond, or deposits. Money earned or paid on interest can be deceiving, however, because the rate of inflation isn’t taken into account. A high inflation rate can erode purchasing power, and at the same time, reduce the value of payments on debt in real terms, which is why the real interest rate provides a better picture of either.
- Using interest rates on debt as an example: A borrower would benefit from a higher inflation rate if the rate of interest were lower. Yet, the bank issuing the debt would be on the losing side because it would earn no interest in real terms. That would be especially so if rates are fixed compared to adjustable-rate mortgages.
- So how does monetary policy affect real interest rate? The Federal Reserve can influence the direction of the economy with its monetary policy. High inflation may push the central bank to tighten monetary policy, while low inflation could spur looser policy. When looking at the data from FRED comparing the federal funds effective rate (which is the weighted average rate that borrowing institutions pay to lending institutions) to the consumer price index from July 1954 to July 2022, real interest rates were positive most of the times, except in certain periods, such as the mid-1970s and early 2000s.
- In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the federal reserve followed a zero-interest-rate policy fro, December 2008 to December 2015 to spur economic growth. Inflation tended to stay below 2 percent during that time, and the target range for the deferral funds rate was pegged between 0 and 0.25 percent. The fed slowly started to raise interest rates to keep up inflation beginning in 2016.
- At the start of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, though, rates were lowered to close to zero to help aid in economic recovery. But as inflation started to creep up in 2021, the Federal reserve gas lagged in its response with rate increases.
- If the inflation rate exceeds the nominal interest rate, then the real interest rate becomes negative. Negative real interest rates are bad for savers because (in terms of purchasing power) they do not actually earn interest from their deposits when adjusting for inflation. It is also bad for banks because inflation reduces the real return of a loan.
- Lower real interest rates results in businesses and households buying more because they have an easier time borrowing money when real interest rates are lower. Since people buy more, economic output grows.


What I need to do with the Data:
- Percentage Change of Economic Indicators across years and/or recessions?
- What other data am I comparing to?
- Interest Rates: Nominal vs Real Interest Rate?
